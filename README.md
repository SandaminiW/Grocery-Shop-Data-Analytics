Grocery Shop Data Analytics using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across various grocery outlets. The dashboard tracks key metrics, such as total sales, average sales per item, the number of items sold, and the average customer rating. The analysis breaks down data by outlet size, item type, fat content, and location type, offering insight into the highest performing categories. Visuals show trends in sales over time, the relationship between outlet establishment year and sales, and the distribution of items by fat content. The dashboard also compares the performance of outlets by tier and size.

7. All Metrics by Outlet  Type -:

## Final Conclusions

The analysis reveals that supermarkets (particularly Supermarket Type 1) generate the highest sales, while grocery stores perform significantly lower. Items categorized under fruits, snack foods, and household products are the top contributors to sales. Sales are largely driven by regular-fat items. Tier 3 outlets outperform Tier 1 in total sales, suggesting that larger or more widespread outlets might have a better reach. The average rating of 3.9 indicates moderate customer satisfaction. Outlet establishment year correlates with increased sales growth up until 2018, followed by a drop, which could indicate market saturation or external factors affecting performance in recent years.
